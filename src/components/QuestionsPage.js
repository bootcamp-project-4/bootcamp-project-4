                <h2>Extraordinary collective of superheroes</h2>
                <p>When an earthquake occurs, we are the superheroes that answer the call! Depending on the magnitude of the earthquake, we select the hero with the right expertise for the job.
                </p>
                <p>This app allows us to keep track of each hero's workload, log each incident that they attend, and display their vacation days accrued in their hero profiles.</p>
                <h3>How to use this App</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1: Click on "Find Earthquakes" to view incidents that have happened within 24 hours</li>
                    <li>Step 2: To see total amount of incidents attended to by each superhero, click on their portrait</li>
                </ul>
