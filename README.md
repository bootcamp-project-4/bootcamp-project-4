## Objectives:
- To request earthquake data from the USGS API as JSON
- To parse the earthquake data for key information about each incident (i.e. latitude, longitude, magnitude)
- To create markers on a map using the React Leaflet API
- To place different color markers for each earthquake based on the magnitude
- To assign a different superhero based on the magnitude of each earthquake
- To create a running tally of how many incidents each superhero has resolved
- To store each hero's tally persistently in a Firebase database
- To calculate how many vacation days each hero accrues based on their incident tally

## Technology used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS
- JavaScript
- React (Hooks & Routing)
- Firebase

## Product management software used:
- Miro
- Trello
- Slack

## Technical Wins:
- Successfully collaborating with other developers using Git branching, pair programming, and code review
- Passing information between display components and setting up routing between pages
- Creating our own custom map markers and getting them to render onto the map correctly

## Team Wins:
- Clearly communicating expectations and setting ground rules before starting to code
- Scheduling regular meetings with rotating meeting minute duty to capture action items and next steps
- Leveraging process mapping tool (Miro) to visualize features, data flow, and user journey mapping
